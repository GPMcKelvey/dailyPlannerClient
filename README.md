<h3 align='left'>Daily Planner v1.1</h3>
<hr/>
<p>Daily planner is just like it sounds, a place for you to plan your day!</p>
<p>As a nonregistered user you are able to view all events created by users that have been made public. You can see what's going on without signing up!</p>
<p>You can also signup for the site. This allows you to have your own profile where you can create your own events, make them private for just yourself, or make them public for everyone that visits Daily Planner to see.</p>
<p>In addition to creating events, a registered user can also create notes and a todo list in their profile. Allowing you to keep everything you need to plan your day in one spot.</p>
<p>Events, notes, and todo tables are all full CRUD. Allowing users to create, retrieve, update, and delete their data.</p>
<hr />
<h3 align='left'>Role Based Access Control</h3>
<p>Daily Planner implements role based access control to allow the site to be mediated by the admins.</p>
<p>Admins are able to view a list of all non-admin users and delete any users that violate the standards of the site.</p>
